smart twitter client inspired by @hmason's twitter client https://github.com/hmason/tc

goal is to hook it into a semi supervised learning framework i poked around with before http://matpalm.com/semi_supervised_naive_bayes/

only a few hrs old so expect some SERIOUS WIPness!

-- requires
- redis; for the twitter crawling which for now is just tweets
- mongodb; for storing raw tweets augmented with rating info
- twitter gem; (gem install twitter)  https://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter

i specifically DIDNT want to use the userstreaming timeline, find it more interesting
to deal with the raw tweets per person (particularly to pick up conversation stuff)

edit rc.eg.sh and add oauth creds for twitter, this need to be sourced into env for doing the crawl
$ source rc.sh

# start mongo and redis
$ ./start_mongod_and_redis.sh

# add some followers to the queue
$ ./add_users_to_follow.rb mat_kelcey hadoop awscloud

# go fetch some tweets from them
$ ./fetch_new_tweets.rb

# prep some training data by giving a thumbs up and thumbs down
$ ./read_tweets.rb

for now it's 
u: thumbs up
n: neutral
d: thumbs down
x: exit

TODOs semi prioritised...
- examine list of existing users to see who they follow, for the most frequently followed ones add them to the crawl list
- decide on a feature breakdown; 1 feature per token, if_reply, has_link, 
- hook up something dead simple for classification; even word occurences to start with
- hook up semi supervised version
- replace dead simple classifier with redis backed multinomial bayes
