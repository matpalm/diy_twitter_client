worked on extract_vw_features.py

fetch_new_tweets.rb
 - dload tweets based on crawl queue

pre_tokenise_processing.rb
 - set 'read' => false
 - deref urls in sanitised_text
 - split test into { :text_features => { :text_san_urls => String, :urls => [String] } } 
 - state = 'fetched_from_twitter'

tokenize_text.py
 - remove [:text_features][:text_san_urls] and replace it with :tokens, :urls, :user_mentions & :hashtags
 - state = 'tokenized_text' 
 
## vowpal wabbit testing

### dump all articles that have been read

./read_articles_to_vw.py > read.vw

wc -l read.vw
498

### evaluate 

./evaluate.sh

runs
./read_articles_to_vw.py > read.vw
then 50 times runs
 shuf read.vw | ./split_training_test.py 0.1 train.vw test.vw
 cat train.vw | vw -f model --quiet
 cat test.vw | vw -t -i model -p predictions --quiet
 cat test.vw | cut -d' ' -f1 > labels.actual
 cat predictions | cut -d' ' -f1 > labels.predicted
 perf -ACC -files labels.actual labels.predicted -t 0.5 | awk '{print $2}'

in this case there are 7000 features, i'm guessing it's pretty sparse

eg3

with quadratic features.. which ones makes sense?

in order of size
author(1) < mentions(n) ~ hashtags(n) ~ urls(n) < text(N)

author & mentions? yes; represents some aspect of conversation (though one sided)
author & hashtags? yes
author & urls? definitely; some authors have links to good/bad things
author & text? not so sure about this one...

though quadratics with author and mentions are user based so quite narrow.

though hashtags aren't that much better; are they?

before thinking about it too much lets try them all...

-q am -q ah -q au -q at -q mh -q mu -q mt -q hu -q ht -q ut --thread_bits 2

   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 0.7000  0.8195  0.8470  0.8537  0.8889  0.9762 
[1] 0.0560209

ups to only 20000 features; so still quite low...

--- semi supervised approach

iter0
0 split up datasets
 # make train.vw, test.vw, semi_labelled.vw.1 datasets

1 train with training
 shuf train.vw | vw -f model

2 bootstrap the semi labelled dataset
 cat semi_labelled.vw.1 | vw -t -i model -p predictions.1

3 retrain with training and newly labelled
 mkfifo just
 cut -d' ' -f1 predictions.1 > just_predictions
 cut -d' ' -f2- semi_labelled.1 > examples_sans_predictions
 ../weave.py just_predictions examples_sans_predictions > semi_labelled.2
 rm just_predictions examples_sans_predictions
 cat training semi_labelled.2 | shuf | vw -f model # will the shuf here cause grief?

4 label unlaballed
 cat semi_labelled.2 | vw -t -i model -p predictions.2

5 while labeling !changed goto 3
 cut -d' ' -f1 predictions.1 > just_predictions.1
 cut -d' ' -f1 predictions.2 > just_predictions.2
 prediction_dist = distance.py prediections.[12] 
 mv predictions.[21]
 mv semi_labelled.[21]
 goto 3
